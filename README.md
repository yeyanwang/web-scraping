# web-scraping

Automated browsing was enabled by *Splinter* and *WebDriver Manager*. *BeautifulSoup* objects were created to extract HTML code for both Jupyter Notebooks. 
`part_1_mars_news.ipynb` scrapes Mars news from web and stores the information in a list of Python dictionaries. 
`part_2_mars_weather.ipynb` scrapes Mars temperature/weather information from the web and stores the information into a Pandas DataFrame.
`mars_temperature_data.csv` is the output csv file for the Pandas DataFrame with Mars temperature/weather information from part 2. 

### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
- Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). 
- The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted, and stored in a list of dictionaries. 
  ```
  [{'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm",
  'preview': 'For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASAâ€™s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27.'}, ...]
    ```
 
### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
- Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. 
- The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. DataFrame was created with all columns listed on the website. 

  |id|terrestrial_date	|sol	|ls	|month	|min_temp	|pressure|
  |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |
  |0  |2 |2012-08-16|	10|	155|	6|	-75.0|	739.0|
  |1	|13|2012-08-17|	11|	156| 6|-76.0|	740.0|
  |2	|24|2012-08-18|	12|	156	|6|	-76.0|	741.0|
  |3	|35|2012-08-19|	13|	157	|6	|-74.0|	732.0|
  |4	|46|2012-08-20|	14|	157	|6|	-74.0	|740.0|

- The dataset was analyzed using Pandas functions:to answer the following questions:
  1. How many months exist on Mars?
    **12**
  2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
    **1867**
  3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? Plot the average temperature by month.

  **The coldest month in Curiosity's location is month 3.
  The hottest month in Curiosity's location is month 8.**
  
  4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? Plot the results as a bar chart.

  **The month with the lowest atmospheric pressure is month 6.
  The month with the highest atmospheric pressure is month 9.**
  
  5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

  **There is roughly around 675 days in a Martian year from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.**
